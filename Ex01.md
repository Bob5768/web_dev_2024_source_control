# Exercise 1 - Opening and commiting

Opening a remote repository (folder) allows you to make changes and then save those changes in real time. Here are some importanat terms:

1. Repository (repo) - Code you've written for a project. It holds _all_ of the code files. These can be written by you or others who have access to the repository.
2. Commit (save) - _Committing_ code is like saving a snapshot of your work. It will track changes made in each commit for any file you've changed. The commit has two parts:
  - **Summary** - one line about what you changed
  - **Details** - Some more information about what happened. What files did you change? Why? What work still needs to be done? The commit summary helps you and collaborators keep track of files you work on.
3. Push (share) - Put your changes up into the repo. This keeps the repository up to date for anyone else using your work or collaborating on the project.
